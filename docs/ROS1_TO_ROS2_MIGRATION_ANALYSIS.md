   dtoverlay=imx477
   ```

3. **Save and reboot:**
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

4. **Verify camera detection:**
   ```bash
   rpicam-still --list-cameras
   ls /dev/video*
   ```

#### **Testing Commands**
```bash
# 1. Test camera detection
python3 arducam_csi_test.py

# 2. Test ROS 2 camera launch
ros2 launch armpi_fpv_bringup arducam_csi.launch.py

# 3. Test camera topics
ros2 topic list | grep arducam
ros2 topic echo /arducam_csi/image_raw

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**Camera Not Detected**
```bash
# Check CSI interface
ls /dev/video*

# Check IMX477 configuration
cat /boot/firmware/config.txt | grep imx477

# Load camera drivers
sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2

# Verify camera detection
rpicam-still --list-cameras

# If still not working, check config.txt setup
sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
# Ensure these lines are present:
# camera_auto_detect=0
# dtoverlay=imx477
# Then reboot: sudo reboot
```

**Preview Not Showing on VNC**
```bash
# Set correct display
export DISPLAY=:1
# Check VNC connection
vncserver -list
```

**ROS 2 Camera Topics Missing**
```bash
# Check camera launch
ros2 launch armpi_fpv_bringup arducam_csi.launch.py
# Check for errors in launch output
```

**Low Frame Rate**
```bash
# Reduce resolution temporarily
# Check CPU usage during camera operation
# Verify MJPEG format is working
```

### Next Steps After Testing

1. **Camera Calibration**: Run camera calibration for new camera
2. **Vision Algorithm Tuning**: Adjust parameters for higher resolution
3. **Performance Testing**: Verify real-time requirements are met
4. **Integration Testing**: Test with all robot applications
